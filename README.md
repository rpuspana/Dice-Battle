### Game requirements
1. You can play the game on single 10.4" screen or bigger and a screen resolution of at least 800x600.

2. An internet connection so that the game can display button images

3. The browser's JavaScript setting turned on. We need this setting in order for the game to generate the dice faces, keep track of the player scores, declare the winner, open the menu, go back and close the menu.
Go to your browser settings and turn on the "allow JavaScript to run on all websites" setting.

4. Internet Explorer 11 shows a message window with the message "Internet Explorer restricted this web page from running scripts or ActiveX controls". Click yes to allow the JavaScript code of the game to run on the page this message appears.
You can also use a IE setting to stop this message from appearing

5. If you're using Firefox, you need to make a quick setting in order to see the beautiful fonts this game uses.  
Otherwise you will get stuck with the default boring fonts.
Here's how to put this setting in place :  
 * open Firefox  
 * type   about:config   in the browser's address bar  
 * in the settings list that appears, search for  security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy  
 * change  security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy value from true to false
