                        <p>
                            The first player with a player score greater or equal than 100.<br>

                        <h4>Player &nbsp;<i class="ion-record" style="font-size:12px; margin-top: 6px; margin-right: 5px"></i></h4>
                        <p>
                            The player name that has the dot next to it, is the active player, begining a new game round.<br>
                            He can use the "roll dice" button, "end turn button", to manipulate the dice and increase his score, or the other two buttons to restart the game or reach the game's main menu.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Player score</h4>
                        <p>
                            The first sum shown under the player's name.<br>
                            It represents the sum of all round scores gained by the player throughout the game.<br>
                            At the end of each round this score is compared to 100, to see which player won.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Round score</h4>
                        <p>
                            The sum in the red rectangle that appears under the player's score.<br>
                            Each time a user clicks on the "roll dice" button the sum of both dice is added 
                            to the existing round score (which will be 0 at first).<br>
                            To add the round score to the total score, the player must end his turn by 
                            clicking the "end turn" button.<br>
                            Keep in mind that different numbers shown on each dice will affect the current player's round score.<br>
